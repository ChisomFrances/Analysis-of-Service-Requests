# Analysis-of-Service-Requests

## Overview

A company provides advertising and financial services to businesses and individuals across different provinces. They collect data on every service request received from their customers on a daily basis through an internal system. This data includes the location of the request, the service type, and the request status. As the company expands, they realize that they need to have a better understanding of their clients’ needs and preferences in order to improve their services. To overcome this challenge, the company is looking to hire a data analyst who can help them to process and analyze data from their various data sources, including the location report sheet, service type report sheet, and request status report sheet. The data analyst will be responsible for analyzing and managing the company’s data, as well as providing insights to help the company make better decisions.

## Process

The dataset used for this analysis contained three reports — locations, request status, and service type. The locations report recorded the request ID, the date the request was made, and the province from which it originated. The service type report included the request ID and the type of service requested, while the request status report included the request ID, the paid amount, the quotation amount, and the request status.

During my analysis, I identified several key questions that could be addressed with the data, such as: how many requests does the company receive daily, what is the total revenue generated by the company, what is the percentage of completed, pending and cancelled request, what is the most popular service requested by clients.

Next, I explored the data to identify any duplicates, null, or missing values in the dataset. Additionally, I modified the data type of the request ID column to text and renamed the Lon and Lat columns in the locations sheet to Longitude and Latitude for clarity.

Finally, I analyzed the data to identify trends within the company and used visualizations to illustrate my findings.

## Insights

After analyzing the data, I created an [interactive dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYzJkNmEzMDAtY2ZiYy00NDA2LTgxY2MtZmJlM2MxNjkzYTRiIiwidCI6IjlmYzAwNmVhLTg5ZTQtNDRiYS04YWQzLTQ0YTg1ZmEyZjlkNiJ9) to provide a visual representation of the analysis and obtained the following insights:

Total Received Requests: From November 2011 to September 2022, the company received 1152 requests.
Average daily requests: The company received an average of 4 requests daily.
Service Type: The company offers both advertising and financial services. The analysis revealed that advertising services generated more revenue than financial services.
Completed, Pending and Cancelled Requests: Within the same period, 560 requests were completed, 352 requests were pending and 240 requests were cancelled.
Total Revenue: After requests were completed, the company’s total revenue was $291,548.
Total Revenue by Region: Among all provinces, the company generated the most revenue from Riyadh, which accounted for 22.81% of its total revenue for the year. In contrast, Al Qassim was the province with the least revenue generation, accounting for only 4.70% of the total revenue for completed requests.

## Conclusion

This analysis provided valuable insights into the company. For instance, it allowed them to identify which provinces were generating the most requests and track trends over time. By doing so, they can determine if certain provinces are experiencing a surge in demand for a particular service and adjust their resources accordingly.

Furthermore, the analysis provided the company with a better understanding of which services were most in demand and which were less popular. This information could be used to determine which services to prioritize and which ones to promote more aggressively.

Finally, this analysis allowed the company to track the progress of each request and ensure that customers were being served efficiently. By monitoring the requests, they could identify any issues that may arise and address them quickly.

Overall, the insights gained from this analysis will help the company make informed decisions regarding its services, resources, and customer service.
